# Python for Data Analysis - Learning Journey

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter Notebooks that I created while learning Python libraries, following the "Python for Data Analysts" series by Luke Barousse on YouTube.  These notebooks cover various Python libraries commonly used in Data science, Machine learning, and Data Analytics serving as my personal learning journey and exploration of the fields.

## About the Content

These notebooks are primarily based on the concepts and techniques taught in Luke Barousse's YouTube series.  They include practical examples and exercises as I worked through the videos, allowing me to solidify my understanding of each library and its applications.

The notebooks are organized to reflect the progression of the learning material, covering topics such as:

* **NumPy:** Working with arrays and numerical data.
* **Pandas:** Data manipulation and analysis using DataFrames.
* **Matplotlib:** Creating visualizations and plots.
* **Seaborn:** Statistical data visualization.
* **Other Libraries:** Datasets, ast, etc 

## Disclaimer

These notebooks are primarily for educational purposes and represent my personal understanding of the material at the time of creation.  While every effort has been made to ensure accuracy, the code and explanations may not be exhaustive or perfect. Please use these notebooks responsibly and at your own discretion.

## Feedback and Contributions

While this repository is mainly for my personal learning, I welcome feedback and suggestions for improvement.  If you find any errors or have ideas for enhancements, feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.
